### 2. Documentation
- Document ALL changes in README.md
- Keep README simple and short
- Use bullet points for changes
- Date each update clearly

### 3. Design Reference

- Match PROMME website styles and layout
- Keep industrial/professional theme
- Use similar color schemes (purple/blue gradients)

### 4. Responsive Design
- **MUST BE MOBILE RESPONSIVE**
